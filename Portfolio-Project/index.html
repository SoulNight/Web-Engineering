            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Bridging the gap between mechanical and software engineering, I specialize in aerospace manufacturing, spacecraft integration, and full-stack development. At Northrop Grumman, I contributed to mission-critical spacecraft assembly, ensuring precision and efficiency in hardware integration.</p>
            <p>My expertise spans Python, JavaScript, C++, Swift, React, Firebase, and SQL, enabling me to build full-stack applications, web solutions, and mobile apps. I also apply Fusion 360 and Prusa 3D modeling to design and prototype mechanical components for engineering applications.</p>
            <p>Beyond engineering, I have been involved in leadership and veteran advocacy. While at Saddleback College, I served as President of the Society of American Military Engineers (SAME) student chapter and Director of Veterans Affairs, leading initiatives to help veterans transition into STEM careers by connecting them with resources, mentorship, and industry opportunities. My contributions have been recognized with Congressional and Senatorial commendations for leadership and service.</p>

              <p>Through the e-NABLE Hand Project, we designed and built free, 3D-printed prosthetic limbs for underprivileged children. Using SolidWorks, 3D printing, and Arduino Uno muscle sensors, we created assistive devices that respond to muscle movements. Working in Saddleback College’s Advanced Manufacturing Lab alongside engineers from Swift Engineering Inc., faculty, and staff, we developed functional and accessible prosthetics that offer kids mobility, confidence, and independence—at no cost to their families.</p>
